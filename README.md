# Using the IARC nextflow bioinformatics pipelines course 2018

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/IARCbioinfo/nextflow-course-2018](https://badges.gitter.im/IARCbioinfo/nextflow-course-2018.svg)](https://gitter.im/IARCbioinfo/nextflow-course-2018?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The aim of this course is to enable participants to use the bioinformatics pipelines developed at IARC using nextflow.

## Description of the course

__Learning objectives__  
After completing this course, participants will be able to use the IARC nextflow bioinformatics pipelines and more specifically:
- set pipeline parameters and configuration
- execute, resume and debug pipelines,
- trace and visualise pipeline execution,
- run the pipelines on workstation or on a high performance computing cluster,
- use github and Docker/Singularity containers to run reproducible analyses,
- understand the basis concepts of the nextflow language used to describe the pipelines.

Please note that the development of pipelines will only be very briefly covered in this course.

## Agenda and slides

__Wednesday 23 May__  
09:00-10:00	Introduction to bioinformatics pipelines, nextflow, docker, Github and the IARC organization  
10:00-10:30	Practical application: running your first pipeline  
10:30-11:00	Break  
11:00-11-30 The hidden structure of nextflow: work folder and configuration  
11:30-12:30	Practical application: configuring, crashing, resuming and debugging pipelines

__Thursday 24 May__  
09:00-09:30	Introduction to HPC clusters and running pipelines on a cluster.  
09:30-10:30	Practical application: trace and visualise pipeline execution with log files.  
10:30-11:00 Break  
11:00-11h30 Introduction to the nextflow language: understanding what the pipelines are doing  
11:30-12:30	Practical application: advanced usages toward reproducibility (choosing a container, Github releases and branches, modifying a pipeline etc.)

## Gitter Chat

A [gitter channel]() is open for the course. This will allow participants to discuss on their projects but also to ask any question regarding the course.

## Laptop setup

Laptops use Ubuntu 16.04.

Nextfloz is already installed and in `~/bin`, which is in your `PATH`.

Docker is already installed. If you are curious, here is how to install it on Docker [website](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/).

If you need a good text editor, [Atom](https://atom.io) is also installed.
